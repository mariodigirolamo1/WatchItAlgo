# WatchItAlgo
Visualize Algorithms in ComposeUI!

# How does it work?
As you open the application you'll see a list of algorithms that you can choose from.<br>
Clicking on one of such algorithms cards, you'll get to that algorithm animation screen.<br>
In such animation screen you'll be able to go through the algorithm step-by-step visually, so that you can get a grasp of what it does with no code.<br>

## Demo Description
You can move into the algorithm step-by-step at your own click pace or you can let it `Autoplay`.

You have various degress of autoplay speeds and you can update it on the fly if you're already autoplaying without interrupting the execution or set it before starting the autoplay.

You can interrupt the autoplay by clicking the pause button or by directly clicking on `Step` or `Reset`, these will also interrupt the autoplay while completing the requested action.

The `Reset` button will allows you to restart the algorithm flow from a clean slate.
