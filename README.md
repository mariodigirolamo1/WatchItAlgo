# WatchItAlgo
Visualize Algorithms in ComposeUI!

# How does it work?
As you open the application you'll see a list of algorithms that you can choose from.<br>
Clicking on one of such algorithms cards, you'll get to that algorithm animation screen.<br>
In such animation screen you'll be able to go through the algorithm step-by-step visually, so that you can get a grasp of what it does with no code.<br>
